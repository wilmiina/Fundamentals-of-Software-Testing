> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
     It was fairly straightforward. Didn't run into any additional issues.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
    The instructions were pretty clear and easy to follow even though at first glance the task seemed very difficult. After I took some deep breaths and refocused, I realised the test case wasn't asking for too much of me.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
    I don't have enough experience to start recommending anything outside of what I've seen and tried.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
    VSCode and TextEdit on MacBook.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
    No I didn't apart from my own panicking.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
    No I didn't. I've used GitHub succesfully in other courses.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
    I don't think I am adept to weigh in on this.


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
    Programming languages proficiency, a good understanding of SDLC, testing technique knowledgeability


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
    I feel like my soft skills are up to par, obviously a personal development is an ongoing endeavour, but at 42 years old I do have some sort of a grasp on these.
    The technical skills are still a work in progress but that's why I am a student.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
    I definitely feel like the final project was what made me understand the entire process much better. I am a very hands on learner and therefore might have needed actual bite sized tasks throughout the course instead of the theory quizzes.
